MirraMax Quick Start Guide
--------------------------

Prerequisites (Windows):
- ADB (platform-tools) installed and in PATH.
- FFmpeg/ffplay installed (add to PATH). Prefer a build with NVIDIA support (ffmpeg compiled with --enable-cuda --enable-cuvid --enable-nvenc).
- USB cable (USB 3 recommended).
- Poco F5: Developer Options -> USB Debugging enabled.

Step 1: Get builds from GitHub Actions
- After pushing repo, run Actions workflow.
- Download artifacts:
  - MirraMax_Android_apk (app-debug.apk)
  - MirraMax_PC.zip (contains run_mirror.bat, ffplay wrapper, control-client.py)

Step 2: Install Android APK
- adb install -r MirraMax_Android.apk
- On phone: allow USB debugging and allow screen capture when prompted.

Step 3: Forward ports (USB)
- On PC open terminal:
  adb forward tcp:5004 tcp:5004
  adb forward tcp:5005 tcp:5005

Step 4: Start Windows receiver
- Unzip MirraMax_PC.zip
- Double-click run_mirror.bat
- The script starts ffplay to receive video and also launches control client examples.

Controls:
- Press R to start/stop recording (if enabled)
- Use control-client.py to send tap/swipe/key events (see examples in the script).

Notes:
- If HEVC hardware decode on Windows is missing, install "HEVC Video Extensions" from Microsoft Store.
- If ffplay playback fails, try editing ffplay_wrapper.bat to change hwaccel flags (it tries NVIDIA CUVID first).
